Class Notes
=============

#### Week 1 | 7/28/13

Syllabus Review
--------------
- We went through the syllabus and talked a bit about class expectations simultaneously. We learned a great deal about one another.
	- ~50% of the class want to learn industry standard practices for building web sites.
	- A portion of the class wants to make "Web Apps", though those were clearly difficult to define.
	- ~33% of the class wanted to learn to deploy their own server environments and IT.
	- ~33% of the class wanted to learn server-side programming (PHP or NodeJS)

- The point system needed to be updated in the syllabus. Don't know how that deleted itself. Sorry about that!

Campfire
--------------
### [MFADT Web 3 Campfire](https://arbitrary.campfirenow.com/a3959)

I've opened the CampFire up for guest access to simplify the invite structure. While this repository is public, I'm going to kindly request the following rules:

- Do not share this link outside of either section of Web 3.
- Follow the same guidelines for behavior that you would with any communication form within the University. Treat it like the MFADT mailing list, but just for our class. 


Process
--------------
- Talked a good amount about my process. Hoped to inspire students into the notion that efficiency means time spent working on ideas and not on finding lost data.
	- Mentioned the idea of [Mise en place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place), the French term for "Everything in Order".
- Use the Hot Keys! Will go over some more of those as we go.
- OSX Utility Software I use
	- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)
	- [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/)
	- [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com/)
- Also talked about backup strategies.
	- [Backblaze](http://www.backblaze.com/)
	- [Arq](http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/)
	- [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com)

Windows users, happy to find equivalents and edit this document later if needed.

I talked a bit about my versioning system for managing and organizing projects. I've included my project template directory for your use. As a general reminder:

- Keep house in each directory in a way of your choosing. For design I like to organize by extension ("psd", "ai"). For code sometimes I organize by repositories or different features ("full-site","landing-page","prototypes").

- Documents always gets a bit messy. Open to suggestions on how to improve that.

- Review is for documentation. Dated directories with photographs, wireframes, sometimes builds of a whole version go in there.


GitHub
--------------
- Talked a bunch about Git and GitHub. The most important thing to remember:
	- Git is not GitHub.
	- Git is software for remembering milestones of milestones.
	- GitHub is a social network for programmers built around sharing Git repositories.

- Additional Info
	- [Git Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).
	- [Git Flow](https://gist.github.com/jkosoy/5903617).

In the coming weeks I'll talk about Git workflows in more detail.
